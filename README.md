### traefik

https://github.com/containous/traefik

Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components (Docker, Swarm mode, Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Rancher, Amazon ECS, ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically. Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the only configuration step you need.

### drone

https://github.com/drone/drone

Drone is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.

### registry-ui

https://github.com/Joxit/docker-registry-ui

This project aims to provide a simple and complete user interface for your private docker registry. You have the choice between two versions, the standard interface and the static interface.

In the standard interface, there is no default registry, you need to add your own within the UI. You can manage more than one registry server. All registries will be stored in the local storage of your browser. No configuration is needed when you launch the UI.
